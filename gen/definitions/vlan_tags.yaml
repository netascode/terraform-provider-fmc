res_description: >-
  This plural resource manages a bulk of VLAN tags.
  The FMC API supports quick bulk creation of this resource. Deletion of this resource is done one-by-one or in bulk, depending of FMC version. Modification is always done one-by-one.
  Updating/deleting `fmc_vlan_tags` can thus take much more time than creating it
