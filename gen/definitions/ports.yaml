  This plural resource manages a bulk of Ports.
  The FMC API supports quick bulk creation of this resource. Deletion of this resource is done one-by-one or in bulk, depending of FMC version. Modification is always done one-by-one.
  Updating/deleting `fmc_ports` can thus take much more time than creating it

      Map of ports. The key of the map is the name of the individual Port. Renaming Ports in bulk
      is not yet implemented.

          Port number in decimal for TCP or UDP. Otherwise a protocol-specific value.

      - model_name: protocol
        type: String
        description: >-
          IANA protocol number or Ethertype. This is handled differently for Transport and Network layer protocols.
          Transport layer protocols are identified by the IANA protocol number (e.g. 6 means TCP, and 17 means UDP).
          Network layer protocols are identified by the decimal form of the IEEE Registration Authority Ethertype
          (e.g. 2048 means IP).
