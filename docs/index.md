# FMC Provider

The FMC provider provides resources to interact with a Cisco Secure FMC (Firewall Management Center) instance. It communicates with FMC via the REST API.

We strongly recommend to use `-parallelism=1` option with Terraform. The FMC REST API currently does not support parallel create/update/delete operations.

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| FMC      | 7.2     |

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "fmc" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  url      = "https://10.1.1.1"
}
```
