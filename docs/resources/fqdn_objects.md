# fmc_fqdn_objects (Resource)

This plural resource manages a bulk of FQDN. The FMC API supports quick bulk creation of this resource. Deletion of this resource is done one-by-one or in bulk, depending of FMC version. Modification is always done one-by-one. Updating/deleting `fmc_fqdn_objecs` can thus take much more time than creating it

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_fqdn_objects" "example" {
  items = {
    fqdn_1 = {
      description    = "My FQDN 1"
      fqdn           = "www.example.com"
      dns_resolution = "IPV4_AND_IPV6"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

  - Default value: `FQDN`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) UUID of the managed FQDN.
