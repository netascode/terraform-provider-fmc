# fmc_networks (Resource)

This plural resource manages a bulk of Networks. The FMC API supports quick bulk creation of this resource. Deletion of this resource is done one-by-one or in bulk, depending of FMC version. Modification is always done one-by-one. Updating/deleting `fmc_networks` can thus take much more time than creating it

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_networks" "example" {
  items = {
    networks_1 = {
      description = "My Network 1"
      prefix      = "10.1.1.0/24"
    }
  }
}
```
