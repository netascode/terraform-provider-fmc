# fmc_hosts (Resource)

This plural resource manages a bulk of Hosts. The FMC API supports quick bulk creation of this resource. Deletion of this resource is done one-by-one or in bulk, depending of FMC version. Modification is always done one-by-one. Updating/deleting `fmc_hosts` can thus take much more time than creating it

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_hosts" "example" {
  items = {
    hosts_1 = {
      description = "My Host 1"
      ip          = "10.1.1.1"
    }
  }
}
```
