# fmc_ports (Data Source)

This data source can read the Ports.

    "ports_1" = {

  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `domain` (String) The name of the FMC domain
- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of ports. The key of the map is the name of the individual Port. Renaming Ports in bulk is not yet implemented. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `description` (String) Optional user-created description.
- `id` (String) UUID of the managed Port.
- `overridable` (Boolean) Indicates whether object values can be overridden.
- `port` (String) Port number in decimal for TCP or UDP. Otherwise a protocol-specific value.
- `protocol` (String) IANA protocol number or Ethertype. This is handled differently for Transport and Network layer protocols. Transport layer protocols are identified by the IANA protocol number (e.g. 6 means TCP, and 17 means UDP). Network layer protocols are identified by the decimal form of the IEEE Registration Authority Ethertype (e.g. 2048 means IP).
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'ProtocolPortObject'.
